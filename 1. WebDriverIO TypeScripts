Downloads - 
Visual Studio  - Download from Google 
NodeJs - Download from Google        // Verify command: node -v   Also check npm -v which gives npm version that comes along with nodejs

Created project - Or go to the folder 

Open VS - Click file - Click open folder - Select the path of folder project - click select 

for new project - 
npm init 

it will ask some questions just go ahead with that, it will ask to git repository - Ask team what to add here, 

install @wdio/cli - it will download all the required packages 

npx wdio config     //Here we can select the framework like cucumber, pom, language

once you are done with the above for typescript it may ask to save the configuration and it will provide those configurations 

so we just need to  create json file to store the typescript configurations -> This will auto-suggest the code of typescript very usefull 

tsconfig.json -> copy all the configurations suggested on the cmd 


# All the dependencies will be listed under the package.json folder 

#It wil automatically create a demo feature to test 

#Run test commond - 
npx wdio wdio.config.ts 



#To Generate the step definition automatically we can use the chrome extension tiny gherkin 
copy and paste the feature it will generate the steps for you 


#browser.url()

element -> $(' .heading') 


variable we can use in TypeScripts are - var, len, const 

#For function we write async 

#For elements and other part we use await 



#If we get an error regarding EPCS targetting such as then 
we just need to add a target under tsconfig.json 
"target" "ES5"


#if function returning something then we don't need t add async before function 
if we are not returning normal function we can provide the asyn before the function 



#Manage multiple URL - We have video for that as well 

Change the URL run time - Pass environment variable 

process.env.ENV = to get the param from the cmd in node

process.exit() to terminate the program so we can add a condition and terminate the program 


###Right click to steps to open the step definition for the statements - 

Create new folder .VSCODE -> settings.json 
under it add below - 
{
    "cucumberautocomplete.steps": ["test/steps/*.ts"],
    "cucumberautocomplete.strictGherkinCompletion": true
}


###Import issue fixed - 
add new thing under tsconfig,ts json file
basepath= {./}  or somthing 
then direct we can import - import from "src/path"

also need to install one dependacies from cmd 

nps install tsconfig-paths    // after that only above will work 

after that in under wdio config.ts -> under cucumberOpt -> requireModule: ["tsconfig-paths/register"]


#For upgrade the packages version which under packages.json

####Send the data from json file - import JSON file for test data

create a jsonfile .json form data 
enter the data into json file - 

{
"firstname": "sushant"
"lastname": "lastname"
"mobile": "9503967719"
}

then import the json file in step definition file where you want to use the json file 

before this you need to go to tsconfig.ts and there need to add below 
resolveJsonModule: true 

after above it will show/auto-populate the json file into import 


then in step file - user filename.data 

eg, filename.firstname
lastname.firstname
mobile.firstname


### Now we send the path of the json file where we have stored the data and send that path as a parameter from feature file to step definition -
