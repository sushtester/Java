Headless browser - the actual browser UI is not get loaded here, so normally in browser GUI thing such as html, css, javsscript 
get time to render and because of this scripts takes time to execution

but for headless browser such GUI thing not comes into picture so time for execution get reduced 

Chrome - 
ChromeOptions options = new ChromeOptions();
options.addArguments("--headless");
or 
options.setHeadless(true);
WebDriver driver = new ChromeDriver();
