#JAVA - 
#1. How to find the position of the text under the string 
-> indexOf()
String name= "sushant sudhir pawar sudhir";
name.indexOf("Sudhir"); // which also includes the white spaces 
name.indexOf("Sudhir", 9); // which also includes the white spaces 

#2. How to set a default condition in the switch statment 
switch(day){
case 1: 
 System.out.println(c);
 break;
 
case 1: 
 System.out.println(c);
 break;
 
default:
 System.out.println(c);
 break;
 
}

#3. print the arrays elements using for each loop 

#4.public class HelloWorld {   //What is the output of the code 
    
       void addMethod(){
        int a=10;
        int b=20;
        int c= a=b;
        System.out.println(c);
    }
     public static void main(String []args){         
         addMethod();         
        System.out.println("Hello World");       
     }
}

#4. Conact() is better than + because + operator always creates a new string BUT contact method creates new object only when string length is greater than zero

#5. How to restrict the class to be inheriate?
-> final class

#6. How to retsrict create object of the class?->
abract class/ interface class we can not create an object 

#7. this. is a instance of the class & we can not use that in static method 

#8. What happn if you try to accees the private varibale in other class - // It will throw the complile time error 

#8. What happnes if you try to modified the final varibale/attribute - // It will throw the complile time error, can not assign value to the final variable

#9. Why inheritance - Code Reusablity, Why Encapsulation - secure the data (read only for get method & write only for set method)

#10. can we acess static methods using obj of the class in java?
-> No, we can not call the static methods of the class using object of the class, those only called using the class name 

#11. Can we write the static methods in the abtract class?
-> We can write the static methods in the abstract class BUT we can not write the static method as a abtstact method(method with no body) as we can't overide the static methods

#12. Which methods in the class we can't overide?
-> static methods
-> Private method 
-> final method 

#13. OOPS in shots 
Java Encapsulation - Getter setter - to hidden the sesitive information we can use this 
Java Inheritance - To reuse the methods, varibales in the super class we use this, code reusability 
Java Interface - We use to write the abtsract methods (methods witout body), also to restric the user to create the object of the class
Java Polymorphism - To overide the methods written in the super class 

#14. Which methods we can write under the interface?
abstract methods which dosen't have a body 
static methods with body which can call directly using interface class name 
defaut method with body - This also called by class obj where the interface is implements 

#15. Double is a number with a decimal, eg - 1212.23
int no= 234; //Covert this to double 
double number = (int) no;  // casting the int to double 
SYSO(number) //234.00

#16. Method Overloading - Where it use (concept of a java polymorphism)
same method with different param is called as a method overloading 

#17. Method overiding - Where it is use (concept of a java polymorphism)
Parent class method get overide into chlid class 

#18. StringBuilder str= new StringBuilder("pavan");
String name= str;
SYSO(name)
-> Compile error as StringBuilder obj need to covert to toString()

#19. How to call defaut constructer under parameterized cunstructer - 
Using this keyword 

#20. How to call  constructer under base class - 
using super keyword 

#21. What is StateElementrefrerance exception - It comes when element get changed from the DOM or element get deleted from the (Document Object Module ) 
DOM structure of HTML structured on which element is present  

EG. Once element is found so in selenium the elememnt reference it get saved as a referenceID in the memory, now in some application if we scroll down the page
or perfrom any action on the same page then that element get removed from the dom, so if we try to access that element it gives stale element refrenece exception 

To overcome the exception - 
Refresh the page - driver.navigat().refresh()

Or add element in try and catch or add explicit wait

#22. What is the difference between URL & URI  - 
URL - to get the location or address of the resource 
URI - to find the resource
