#JAVA - 
#1. How to find the position of the text under the string 
-> indexOf()
String name= "sushant sudhir pawar sudhir";
name.indexOf("Sudhir"); // which also includes the white spaces 
name.indexOf("Sudhir", 9); // which also includes the white spaces 

#2. How to set a default condition in the switch statment 
switch(day){
case 1: 
 System.out.println(c);
 break;
 
case 1: 
 System.out.println(c);
 break;
 
default:
 System.out.println(c);
 break;
 
}

#3. print the arrays elements using for each loop 

#4.public class HelloWorld {   //What is the output of the code 
    
       void addMethod(){
        int a=10;
        int b=20;
        int c= a=b;
        System.out.println(c);
    }
     public static void main(String []args){         
         addMethod();         
        System.out.println("Hello World");       
     }
}

#4. Conact() is better than + because + operator always creates a new string BUT contact method creates new object only when string length is greater than zero

#5. How to restrict the class to be inheriate?

#6. How to retsrict create object of the class?

#7. this. is a instance of the class & we can not use that in static method 

#8. What happn if you try to accees the private varibale in other class - // It will throw the complile time error 

#8. What happnes if you try to modified the final varibale/attribute - // It will throw the complile time error  annot assign a value to final variable

#9. Why inheritance - Code Reusablity, Why Encapsulation - secure the data (read only for get method & write only for set method)
