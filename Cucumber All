BDD- Behaivor Data Driven

#1. Feature files - create differebt scenarios using Gherkins keyworks such as given when then and 

#2. Step defination - Write methods to map the keywords wriiten in features file, for every annotaion there will be a method, each feature there will different 
step defunation 

#3. Utility - for common generic functions 

#4. Test Runner 


#Create maven project - Then download cucumber for ecclipse plugin - Help - cucumber for ecclipse plugin

#Pox.xml - From cucumber java skeleton - add properties, dependencies and build 

#Create appfeatured package in which add a feature file, Search.Feature 


#1. We need to download the Cucumber plugin for ecllipse
#2. Dependancies - Junit, IO Cucumber 



Note - We can add multiple scenarios in the same feature file - 



Gherkins Keywords such as Given, And, When, And, Then 

Create a Feature package add different features files - 


Features: name of features
  
 Scenarios: name of scenario
   Given
   And 
   When
   And
   Then
 
#Create stepdefination package
For each features file there will be a step definition/glue code/backend code -  where we can make coding for methods 

#Runner class - 
@RunWith(Cucumber.class)
@CucumberOptions(features= "src/test/resources/Features", glue= {"stepsdefinations"}, monochrome = true,
plugin= {"pretty", "html:target/Htmlreports.html"})


public class GoogleRunner {
	
	

}




Parameter for Cucumber -  


Feature: To check the Login flow

  Scenario Outline: Check the valid login with the credentails
    Given Browser of Site is open
    And User is on the Site URL
    When User enter the <username> and <password>
    And Click on the Login button
    Then User should be logging to the application

    Examples: 
      | username | password |
      | aloha    |    12345 |


A. When called parameter from features files, which we called as data table 
So in Example we write the data table 


Here is step definition - We need to change the When name to regular expression for any value and then pass the params in the method 

@When("^User enter the (.*) and (.*)$")
	public void user_enter_the_aloha_test_com_and_mypassword(String username, String password) {
		}


When send parameter we can also add params in double code like 
Feature: To check the Login flow

  Scenario Outline: Check the valid login with the credentails
    Given Browser of Site is open
    And User is on the Site URL
    When User enter the “” and “”
    And Click on the Login button
    Then User should be logging to the application



#Tags- 
Features: name of features
  
@smoke
 Scenarios: name of scenario
   Given
   And 
   When
   And
   Then


So runner file will bel like below - 
@RunWith(Cucumber.class)
@CucumberOptions(features= "src/test/resources/Features", glue= {"stepsdefinations"}, monochrome = true, tags= {“@smoke”}
plugin= {"pretty", "html:target/Htmlreports.html"})

@smoke @regression
Scenario:

Runner- 
tags= {“smoke” And “regression”}
tags= {“smoke” Or “regression”}

tags= “not @Skip”


We can also put tag name to 
@mustRun
Feature



Hooks - 
To run the block of code before and after each scenario 

Scenario Hooks- to run before and after scenario
Step Hooks -  to run before and after steps like when then and
Conditional Hooks - conditional as per the tags 




Create different runner class one is for smoke tags other will be for Sanity testing 


So in the steps definition we can write @Beore and @After methods which called as hook for scenario

Conditional hooks - We can write multiple hooks such as 
@Before (order= 1)
@Before (order =2)

So before each scenarios the hooks before and after will run 

@Before (“@smoke”)

Hooks are invisible to the readers as we defined those in the step definition 


#Background - 
For logins as each scenarios need a login so this common steps so it can put in the background section 

So common steps should be in background 


Backgrounds are visible to the user 


Background: user is logged into the application 
  Given User is on the login page
  When user enter the username and password 
 Then user navigate to the homepage 

Scenario: Check the logout functionality of the application
 When user clicks on logout button
 Then user should loggein out 


Cucumber Reports - 
How to generate HTML reports in the cucumber 
Maven Cucumber Reporting dependancy 

Apache maven plugin build need to add in POM.XML as well

Then add the plugin as json 


Questions - 
Cucumber Keywords - 
Annotations in cucumber - 
Cucumber Tags - smoke, sanity, regression, skip
Keywords uses under the cucumber options - feature, glue, monochrome=true, plugins, tags
Can user perform multiple examples for one scenario outline? - yes 
dryRun= which write in runner class, in the cucumberOpyions when dryRun is true then it checks all the features steps having the implemented methods in step definition or not 


CucumberOptions(feature={}, glue{}, tags= {“smoke” and “santity” and “not @Skip”}, plugin= {}, dryRun= true, )
