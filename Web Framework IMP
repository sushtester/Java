Web Automation Framework - 
As our project is microservice based so we written our framework in that way that we can test our product componenet wise, 
product is collection of different componenet 
For each componenet we have a three high level package 
#1. Page package for particular component:
created different java classes as per pages involved for that componenet where we are storing web elements of the respective page and some actions 
(verification methods)methods which performed on that pages
#2. Test package for particular component:
We created java classes as per the page involved for that componenet where we are writning actual test cases using testNG annotation @before class @Test @After class
also we have wrtitten one Suite setup class where we are initialising env conf such as browser name, URL & test data property files which 
required using @before test method which required to test the particular component
#3. Suite package for particular component:
We created testNG.xml file env basic like dev, stage & prod which contains test classes to run for a particular componenet along with suite level param & test level parameter
also we have test data property file as per the env dev, stage, prod which contaions the test data required to execute test cases of that componenet

Then we have other packages such as 
Base package - 
in base package we created base class which conation @before suite and after suite method where we are initialsing the env name & extent report variables such as
report name, report dir location on which extent report get saved for the respective componenet

Common utiliy package - 
Contain some common utility such as emailread function, checkbox select, radio button select, dropdown select, screenshot

Selenium utility package - 
browser class where we are intialising the browser, created method as per the browsers using constructers 
also wedriver initalistion in browser class also some method such as find element, fluentwaits method such as wait for element till presense, till clickable
till selecteble

Page utility package which is a abtsract class which contaions some common menthods on all the pages -  
Written some common method of the page such as clicking on sign out link which is common for all the page 
footer link click methods 
navigate from one page to another page 
and written some abstarct methods confim() // whether the page is succesffuly opened 
waitForLoad() // wait to load that page as different page take different time to load 

#Listner pkg - Which contains listner class which implememts ITestListner interface which has methods such as OnTestStart(ITestContext context)
OnTestSuccess(ITestResult result) OnTestFail(ITestResult result)  OnTestFinish(ITestContext context)
In testNg.xml file - 
<listners>
<listner class-name= “package name.classname”>

#How execution happens - 
so high level we have 3 env conf property file dev, stage, prod where we stored env conf such as broswr name, url
and we have seprate test data properties for each componenet which we are passing as test parameter from testNg.xml file 
We are doing our execution using the testNg.xml for the respective component, so as I mentioned 
we are passing env name, report name, report dir as a suite level param to before suite method wrtitten in base class & those test data property file location to 
@before test method which written in suite setup class 

first test base class get execute where we written @before suite method which set the env (dev stage or prod) and loads the env configuration as per the env name passing 
so if we are passing env name as dev then it will inialise the dev env conf property file which contains dev url, broswer

then @before test class get executed from the suite set up class which set the test data property files as per the location of property file that we passing from 
the testNG,xml as test level parameter 

then @before class method will call from actual test case class where in will read those test data and store into class valribale 
and then @test method get executes where we are testing the functionality after that it will execute @after class clearing the test data
@after test closing the browser @after suite closing & generate the extent report 

we are using multilevel inheritance 
Test class extends suite set up class (@beforetest) & suitesetup class extends base class (@before suite method)

Page class (web element) is extended by page utility abtsract class (common methods for the pages) which extend by browser class (findByElement, click) 

Questions - 
#1. How you storing the web elements in the page class - 
We are storing web elements in the page class using By class in selenium so By webelementname = by.xpath(); 
#2. How you execute the test cases on different browser - we are passing browser name from env cong property file
#3. How you are executing test cases on different test enviroment - we are passing the env name from the testNG.xml file itself & created invidulal
testNG.xml as per the env 
#4. How to navigate from one page to another page - as soon as we login to the application we land on home page where in homepage page class we have written
navigation method to each page in the application which returns the object of the page class for respective page and then we can perform further action using
that object of the page class 
#5. Waits methods - We are doing that in browser class which under the selenium utility
#6. Driver initialisation - We are doing that in browser class which under the selenium utility
#7. How you passing reading the test data 
#8. How you used inheritance in your project - 
We are using multilevel inheritance in our project so our testclass inheritate suitsetup class (@beforeTest), suitsetup class inheritate the Base class (@before suite)
also our page classes inheritate pageUtility class which contain some abstarct method confirm (), waitforLoad(element) and common page methods and
pageUtility class inheritate browser class which having broswer initialisation and waits methods 
#9. How you use the interface in your project - 
ITestListner - Created listner package with Listner class which implememts ITestListner interface which has methods such as OnTestStart(ITestContext context)
OnTestSuccess(ITestResult result) OnTestFail(ITestResult result)  OnTestFinish(ITestContext context) which it overide
For ITestResult = result.getName() - It gives the method name, result.getTestClass() - Gives class name 
For ITestContext = context.getName() - name of the test
#10. How you use the abstraction in your project - We have wrtiien some abtract method in our pageutility abstarct class such as confirm () waitForLoad()
to confirming the page is open successfully and to wait till the particualr element on the page appears and those abstract methods we are overiding in 
page class and sending the details as per the page to check confirm and waitforload method 
#11. How you use the polymorphism in your project - 
How you use method overiding and method overloading in your project - 
1. Method Overiding - 
a. We have pageutil class where we wriiten the two abstrac public menthods, abstract public Boolean confirm(), abstract public WebElement waitForLoad()
abstract public WebElement waitForLoad() this method use to provide wait for page load which return the webElements to which we need to wait, use in page class 
abstract public Boolean confirm() method which used for all the pages to check the desired page is landed or not, use when want to navigate to page 
above methods we used in our page class using extends pageutil class and overided those as per the page requirements 

b. Public WebElement Apply method in FluentWait class, which we overide and add our element to find 

2. Method overloading - 
a. Select dropdown by id by text - To select the drop down value we have two method with same name but diffrent params selectBy()
selectBy(String) - select.selectByVisibletext(string)
selectBy(int) - select.selectByValue(int)
Select select= new Select(WebElement);
select.selectByVisibleText("name")
select.selectByValue('3')

#12. How you use the custructor in your project - 
a. in browser class we have created two custructor of the browser class with different set of params
browser(brosername, url)
need to pass url of static pages so it will take that instead of url from property file
broswer(browsername) 
which will take default URL from property file

b. used the conustcuter overloading in user difined exception class as well
where we are calling the excpetion class contructer by passing user defined execption msg or without message so it will take default execption class msg
Class UnderAgeException extends Exception  // when creating user difined checked excpetion if want to create unchecked then extends with runtimexception 
  UnderAgeException(){ 
    Super("Age should not less than 18");
  }
   
  UnderAgeException(String message){ 
    Super(message);
  } 

#13. How you attached the scrrenshot of failed test cases - 
under listner class OnTestFail method we are calling screenshot method which capture the screenshot 

ADO Execution - 
We are using azure devops pipeline for execute our test suites, so in azure devops we have created pipelines using YAML file
so in ADO they provides us the microsoft hosted VM's and we can trigger our test cases on those VM's 
we need to add some task in YAML file configutaion regarding the VM details meaning need to provide OS name where we want to execute our test cases 

then also need to write the scripts for maven clean install maven build, authetication details if required 
also the task to publish the report in directory, eg. there is task to show the extent report of execution so we need to configure that as a task 
and finall the script where we need to send the path of the xml file that we want to trigger for that pipeline
also we have added the paratmertes into YAML file such as dev, stage, prod so while running the particular pipeline we need to select the env 


Smoke pipeline 
Regression pipeline
Component wise pipeline if we want to execute the suite for respective componenet


Questions - 
#1. How you trigger the smoke - 
Using smoke pipeline so we have created seprate test cases java classes and testNG.xml which covered the smoke functionality of the application 
and we created pipeline to execute that testNg.xml which we called somke pipeline
so as soon as any deployement happns we trigger the smoke suite and it will trigger in 15 minutes which check only the mojor/importnat functionality 
also we have added some scheduler in smoke pipeline YAML file so smoke get trigged after 3 hours interval automatically and sends us rpeort 

#2. How you execute the regression - 
so in ADO for regression pipeline we have added almost all testNG.xml path which resposible to perform full regression of the application 
we have added those testng.xml in steps so all the testNG.xml will execute one after one 
we cant executed those paraller because there is a account dependacy between the test cases as we are using some common accounts 

ADO YAML file contaions:
parameters: env parameters
name: name of the suite
jobs: 
  job - name of the job
  steps:
    script - maven install build maven 
    task - screens resolution 
    script - testNG.xml path 
    task - publish report html or extent 
 job
  steps:
    script
    task
    task
    script
