##Implicitly wait - Which need to add after launching and maximize the browser 

driver.manage().window().maximize();
driver.manage().timeouts().implicitlyWait(10, TimeUnit.SECONDS);  //This is for - It sets an implicit wait after the instantiation of WebDriver instance variable.




##Explicitly wait  - Uses when page loaded BUT all the elements are not yet displayed, lets consider it took some time to display then inorder find element we need to add explicitly wait - 

WebDriverWait wait= new WebDriverWait(driver, 10);
wait.until(ExpectedConditions.visibilityOfElementLocated(By.xpath("//body/div[1]/div[3]/form[1]/div[1]/div[1]/div[3]/center[1]/input[1]")));

There is also a fluent wait which means once element find move forward don't wait
