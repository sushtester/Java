further action performed 

driver.manage().window().maximize();
drriver.get(URL)
driver.manage().timeouts().implicitlyWait(10, TimeUnit.SECONDS);  //This is for - It sets an implicit wait after the instantiation of WebDriver instance variable.




#Explicitly wait  - Uses when page loaded BUT all the elements are not yet displayed, lets consider it took some time to display 
then inorder find element we need to add explicitly wait - it's useed to make codition 

WebDriverWait wait= new WebDriverWait(driver, 10);
wait.until(ExpectedConditions.visibilityOfElementLocated(By.xpath("//body/div[1]/div[3]/form[1]/div[1]/div[1]/div[3]/center[1]/input[1]")));
