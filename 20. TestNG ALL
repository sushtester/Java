TestNG - Testng new generation framework 
Purpose - Design test cases in a systmatic way & it's open source 
It's availbale in jar file as well as in maven dependancy - It's only for JAVA - Junit is for java
Advantages - Its generate beutifull HTML reports 
Annotation - also we can add priporities, sequesnces of test cases to excute, also can add dependacies, grouping 
Data provider feature - If test cases want to exceute multiple time, like 10 users login, like we can use multiple data for login 
TDD- Test driven developements 

Sequence - 

@BeforeSwite - 
We can setup browser property like - WebDriverManager.chromedriver.setup()l

@BeforeTest- 
We can lunch the browser - WebDriver driver new = ChrmeDriver();

@BeforeClass - 
We can enter the login for browser URL - if there is any authentication available  

@BeforeMethod- 
Enter the URL

@Test
Actual test case

@AfterMethod - 
For logout 

@AfterClass - 
For Delete all the cookies 

@AfterTest - 
For close the brorswe 

@AfterSwite - 
To generate the test reports 


Runs for each @Test method - This the pair for each @Test
@BeforeMethod 
@Test
@AfterMethod 


#Select Project - Refresh it - Open index.htm - Properties and copy paste that in browser 


Groups - 

@Test(priority=1,groups= "Site")

or for multple groups - 
@Test(group= {"Sanity", "Smoke"})

Groups can also difed on the calss level- 



dependsOnMethos is use to make dependancy of any Test on another Test

(dependsOnMethods = "methodname")


If same testCase want to excute 10 times 

@Test(invocationCount=10) - It can use to run same test multiple times 


###Assert- This is used to check the validations of testNG - 

Assert.assertEquals(titile, "Google", "Title is not matched with the expected")





To run the all the different classes on same time we need to use the TestNg.xml file - 
<suite name= "Roofing">
<test name= "Roofing sanity cases">
<classes>
 <class name= "packagename.class1"/>
 <class name= "packagename.class2"/>
 <class name= "packagename.class3"/>
</classes>

</test>
</suite>


if want to use the groups then can use the groups - 
<groups>
<run>
<include name= "Sanity">
</run>

</groups>


if we want to user the parameters in tesng.xml - 
<parameters name= "url" value= "www.roofing.com"/>
<parameters name= "uname" value= "amol@gmail.com"/>
<parameters name= "pwd" value= "password"/>



Soft assertion 

hard assertion 

TestNg Data provider - how to take the data from the file and like different usname & passwords and use that in the login and password 

Parallel run testNG 

How to exclude particular methonds from the class - 
<methods>
<exclude name= "methodname"/>
</methods>
